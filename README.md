# Getting Started

This frontend uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and production builds.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests (Vitest).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

The build output is minified and includes hashed filenames.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally (useful to sanity-check the `build` output).
